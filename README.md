## 📱 App Proposal: **MapTag 地图捉人**

### 🌟 Overview

**MapTag** is a mobile app that brings the classic game of tag (捉人) into the real world using live location sharing. Designed for friends who want to play games like tag or hide-and-seek outdoors, the app shows everyone’s position on a map and assigns roles like tagger or runner. It’s fun, fast, and feels like a real-time multiplayer game — but in real life.

### 👥 Why We’re Making This

Right now, my friends and I use WeChat’s location sharing to play tag, but it’s hard to keep track of who is “it,” and there’s no structure or rules. **MapTag** solves this by:

* Clearly showing who is the tagger
* Making it easy to join a game room
* Offering multiple exciting game modes
* Adding fun and energy to real-world play

### 🎮 Key Features

* **Live map with moving players**
* **Game rooms**: join by PIN or QR code
* **Multiple modes**: classic tag, infection, elimination, team tag
* **Tag alerts**: sounds and vibrations when you’re tagged
* **Simple and clean design** so anyone can use it easily

### 💡 The Vision

We want MapTag to be:

* The go-to app for outdoor group games
* A way to turn any park or school campus into a playground
* A fun, safe, and exclusive experience for close friends

### 🌍 Our Audience

* Middle and high school students
* Groups of friends looking for fun after school or on weekends
